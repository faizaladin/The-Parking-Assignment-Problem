The Parking Assignment Problem focuses on optimizing the assignment of parking spots to registered students within a campus environment. The objective is to mitigate the ongoing issue of limited parking availability and having unregistered cars on campus. The current lack of a system to distinguish between registered and unregistered students has resulted in an excess of vehicles, making it challenging for faculty, staff, and registered students to have convenient parking. To address this problem, the research aims to implement a structured parking assignment system that allows registered students to have more autonomy over their parking spaces and enables them to report unauthorized parking, thereby alleviating the issue of unregistered parking. The code represents different algorithms and their benefits in assigning parking spots to students.

Using our campus map we were able to estimate and extract the total number of parking spots available to all students

We then devised greedy and optimal algorithms to assign students parking spots that minimized their walking distance from classes and dorms to their parking spot. We applied algorithms to offer students with seniority "better spots" and algorithms to reduce the total walking distance for all students.

We also include the run time of each algorithm.
